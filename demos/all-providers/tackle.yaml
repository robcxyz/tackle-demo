intro:

    Tackle box has a plugins based system of making special actions available by
    importing providers which are groups of hooks with special dependencies. For
    example, there is a `git` provider that has a collection of hooks like `git_clone`
    that depends on `GitPython`, a python package.

    Providers are either imported as part of the base package or lazily imported
    with it's dependencies installed in runtime as they are needed. Providers like
    the `tackle`, `pyinquirer` (prompting), and `system` are in the base where as
    most other providers have their dependencies installed in runtime. For instance
    the AWS provider has a dependency on boto which isn't installed by default.

    Providers as mentioned have hooks. Each hook is called via the `type` keyword.
    Each hook exposes it's own interface that can be viewed at [Docs TBD] + [Help
    Command TBD].

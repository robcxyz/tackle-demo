    Here is an example of the most important hook, the tackle box hook.
    It allows you to call other cookiecutters / tackle boxes and therefore build
    modular / heirarchial sets of instructions. It wraps the main.cookiecutter
    function. The output of this call produces the context that was built during
    the call which is helpful in a variety of ways.
    
    Example:
    {% raw %}
    # In the templates folder you find a classic cookiecutter file structure
    local_tackle_box:
      type: tackle
      template: templates
      when: "{{ docs_confirm }}"
      overwrite_if_exists: true {% endraw %}
   

local_tackle_box:
  type: tackle
  template: templates
  when: "{{ local_tackle_box_confirm }}"
  overwrite_if_exists: true

local_tackle_box_confirm2:

    It outputs a map per this output:
    {% raw %}
    {{ local_tackle_box }} = {% endraw %}{{ local_tackle_box }}
    
    This is very helpful when trying to stitch together different contexts.
